    "Q5) What are the six comparison operators?\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The six comparison operators are:\n",
    "- Greater than (>)\n",
    "- Less than (<)\n",
    "- Greater than or equal to (>=)\n",
    "- Less than or equal to (<=)\n",

    "\n",
    "Q6) What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The assignment operator is used to assign the values to the variable. Equality Operator: The equality operator is used to compare the values of both the variables and the result is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7) Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.\n",
    "Ans: A condition in programming is the state of something in the program thatâ€™s true or false. For example, when looking at the condition of a computer variable, you can use a conditional statement to evaluate the condition of the variable.\n",
